Analysis of a complex network of internal armed conflicts using Gephi software for visualization and metric calculation.

## üìã Project Description

This project analyzes a conflict network with **1078 nodes** and **898 edges**, implemented as part of the Artificial Life course at Universidad del Valle. The analysis focuses on internal conflicts, defined as situations of prolonged violence between governmental forces and armed groups within a State.

**Presentation Date:** April 2024

## üéØ Objectives

- Collect information from reliable sources on armed conflicts.
- Build and model a complex network representing these conflict relationships.
- Use Gephi to visualize the network and identify patterns, critical nodes, and structural properties.
- Analyze network metrics to extract relevant information about conflict dynamics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology and Tools

The project was carried out following these steps:

1.  **Data Collection:** Search and filtering of information in search engines (Google, Google Scholar) and reliable databases.
2.  **Modeling:** Construction of the network where nodes represent entities (countries, armed groups, governments) and edges represent conflict relationships between them.
3.  **Analysis:** Use of **Gephi** software to:
    - Visualize the overall structure of the network and its components.
    - Calculate topological metrics (diameter, radius, clustering coefficient, etc.).
    - Identify communities and key nodes using layout algorithms and filters.
4.  **Interpretation:** Analysis of the results to generate conclusions about the conflicts.

**Main Tool:** [Gephi - The Open Graph Viz Platform](https://gephi.org/)

## üìä Results and Key Metrics

The analysis in Gephi revealed the following network characteristics:

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Nodes | 1078 |
| Edges | 898 |
| Diameter | 13 |
| Radius | 1 |
| Average Path Length | 5.52 |
| Average Clustering Coefficient | 0.139 |
| Number of Weakly Connected Components | 254 |
| Total Triangles | 47 |

## üìà Visualizations and Findings

The analysis enabled the generation of visualizations showing:
- The **overall structure** of the conflict network.
- The distribution of **highly connected nodes** (hubs).
- The **degree distribution** and the **weighted degree**.
- **Betweenness** among nodes.
- The **Closeness Centrality** distribution.
- The **clustering coefficient** of the nodes.

## üé• Network Demo and Video

A dynamic visualization of the network showing its structure and connections was created. You can watch it at the following link:

## üìö Conclusion and Future Work

The network analysis allowed us to verify the type of complex structure presented by global conflicts, highlighting specific cases that offer an interesting historical context. As future work, we propose:
- Expanding the data sources to represent more conflicts and obtain a more complete network.
- Updating the information to include recent developments.
- Exploring the integration of other attributes into nodes and edges (conflict intensity, duration, etc.).
